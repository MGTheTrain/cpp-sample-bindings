                    GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 2.1, February 1999

Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble
---------

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free softwareâ€”to make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other software whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. To understand the concept, you should think of "free software" as "free speech," not as "free beer."

Terms and Conditions for Copying, Distribution, and Modification
----------------------------------------------------------------

1. This License applies to any software or other works which contain a notice placed by the copyright holder(s) stating that it is distributed under the terms of this License. The "Library" refers to a work covered by this License, but does not include works that are merely aggregated with the Library.

2. You may copy and distribute copies of the Library's complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.

3. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 2 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

   a) The modified work must itself be a free software library.
   b) If the work is distributed in source code form, the modified library must be accompanied by a prominent notice stating that you have changed the files, and by the date of any changes.
   c) If the modified library is distributed in object code form or in a form that is otherwise not source code, you must provide access to the source code from where you made the modifications.

4. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
